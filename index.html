      <h3>Scripts power</h3>
      <p>
        Scripts take care of most tasks these days, everything is accomplished according to the combined scripts that the developer hand crafted, and uploaded to cyberspace, to make design pieces I have to answer the question: why? and for who?ðŸ˜¶
      </p>
      <h3>Shapes?</h3>
      <p>
        Even if i just thrown them on the code and watch it happen like i did here; i've designed this for developers and designers or every individual that know how things are on the internet, and get inspired on some cyberart,
        it can crash your browser i'm taking care of this, not elevating to much those numbers variables in the javascript file, maybe not yet.ðŸ˜¶

       <h3>Typos?</h3>
       <p>
        Using regular divs on the internet is not enough anymore, let's complex things a little bit, rotate one a couple of times a little opacity maybe, i can see curves from a lot of lines, it's fun!!
