      <h3>Scripts power</h3>
      <p>
      Scripts take care of mosts tasks these days, everything is accomplished according the combined scripts thats the developer 
hand crafted, and uploaded to the cyberspace, to make design pieces i have to aswer the question: why? and for who? <br>even if i just thrown
them on the code and watch it happen like i did here; i've designed this for developers and designers or every individual that know
how things are on the internet, and get inspired on some cyberart, <br>it can crash your browser i'm taking care of this, not elevating
        to much those numbers variables in the javascript file, maybe not yet.😶
      </p>
      <h3>Shapes?</h3>
      <p>
use regular divs on internet is not enought anymore, let's complex things a little bit, 
      rotate one a couple of times a little opacity maybe, i can see curves from a lot of lines, it's fun!!

       <h3>Typos?</h3>
       <p>
Let's scramble random letters on the background to impress upcoming visitors, 
       maybe they bored because most portifolios we see on internet looks like copy of another copy,
       i'm trying to be creative this time hope you enjoy.
