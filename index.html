      <code>I work with projects of all sizes and ideas, Let's setup a chat</code>
      <p>Most developers like to work inside a box, I'm different. I like to interact with people.
        I believe we can always learn from others point of view.</p>
      <h3>Everything is always changing!</h3>
      <p>We need quick, practical and great solutions, every day is an update day.</p>

       <h3>Present and Future</h3>
       <p>
        Entertainment today is based on looking at a big screen with as many pixels as possible, watching series playing video games
         We spend more time than we imagine glued to the screen, today we have a pocket computer that knows everything about us,
         we become dependent without noticing, totally addicted to technologies and digital interfaces that occupy our eyes for
          more than half of our day, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Calendar, Teams, Spotify, Maps, Waze, Uber ... 
          I work in front of a screen. I can add Visual Studio, Command Terminal, Browsers, Environments, Github ... more than 12 hours,
          that's for sure, if you start counting from when you wake up to turn off the alarm and maybe spend the first 10 minutes daily
          looking at your social networks and a digital interface. After reading the news from the previous day and looking at the clock
          to start the work, it is 8 hours directly in front of two screens, after working in this time of pandemic it increases the amount
           of hours that our eyes are subjected to some kind of digital device. that's what I do. Digital interfaces of any kind.
